**Data Engineer Sales Analysis Project
**This provides a detailed overview of an end-to-end Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI) project, demonstrating how to integrate data from various sources into Snowflake, perform analysis using SQL, and visualize results with Power BI. It covers data generation, extraction, loading, querying, and reporting, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the complete data integration process.

Here, we will explore an end-to-end project that illustrates the complete flow of a Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DWBI) system. We will create a data model, simulate data fetching from an OLTP system, load data into Snowflake, perform ad hoc analysis using SQL, and finally create dashboards using Power BI. This project will help connect the dots about the end-to-end flow of a real production project.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will learn:

How to generate test data using Python. How to extract data from Oracle using Python. How to create a Snowflake account and set up databases, schemas, and tables. How to load data into Snowflake using SnowSQL and the COPY command. How to query data using SQL in Snowflake for ad hoc analysis. How to build reports in Power BI. Tools and Technologies Used All tools used in this project are free:

Python: For test data generation and data extraction. Notepad++: For writing Python code. Excel: As a reference for data. Snowflake: For data warehousing. Power BI Desktop: For creating reports. Project Overview Simplified DWBI Architecture

In a simplified DWBI architecture, we have:
Source Systems: These can include client applications, CRM systems, databases, and flat files. Staging Area: Data is extracted from source systems and loaded into a staging area without transformations. Data Warehouse Layer: Data is transformed and aggregated in this layer, which can be on-premises or in the cloud. Reporting and Dashboarding Tools: Tools like Power BI are used to visualize the data.

Problem Statement
We are working with an offline retail organization that sells thousands of products through 100 retail stores. The organization has been in business for the last 10 years and runs a loyalty program based on customer sales. The CEO wants to generate meaningful insights from this data.

Data Model Design
We will create the following tables:

Dimension Tables: Dim Loyalty Info Dim Customer Dim Store Dim Product Dim Date Fact Table: Fact Orders Attributes of Each Table Dim Loyalty Info: Loyalty Program ID, Program Name, Program Tier, Points Secured. Dim Customer: Customer ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Address, Loyalty Program ID. Dim Store: Store ID, Store Name, Store Type, Opening Date, Address, Manager Name. Dim Product: Product ID, Product Name, Category, Brand Name, Unit Price. Dim Date: Date ID, Date, Day of Week, Month, Quarter, Year, Is Weekend. Fact Orders: Order ID, Date ID, Product ID, Store ID, Customer ID, Quantity Ordered, Order Amount, Discount Amount, Shipping Cost, Total Amount. Data Generation and Extraction Generating Test Data Using Python We will use Python libraries such as Faker and Pandas to generate meaningful test data for our tables. The process involves:

Importing necessary libraries. Generating random data for each column in the dimension tables. Writing the generated data to CSV files. Extracting Data from Oracle To demonstrate data extraction, we will connect to an Oracle database using Python and extract data into CSV files. This involves:

Establishing a connection to the Oracle database. Writing SQL queries to fetch data. Saving the fetched data into CSV files. Loading Data into Snowflake Creating a Snowflake Account To get started with Snowflake, create a free account by signing up on their website. Choose the appropriate cloud provider and region.

Setting Up Snowflake Create a database and schema in Snowflake. Create tables based on the data model designed earlier. Define primary and foreign keys for the tables. Loading Data Using SnowSQL Use the SnowSQL command-line tool to load data from the CSV files into the Snowflake tables. The process involves:

Creating a file format in Snowflake. Creating a stage to hold the data files. Using the PUT command to upload files to the stage. Using the COPY command to load data from the stage into the tables. Ad Hoc Analysis Using SQL Once the data is loaded, we will perform ad hoc analysis using SQL queries. This includes:

Writing over 25 SQL queries of varying complexity to extract meaningful insights from the data. Using analytical functions and clauses to derive results. Creating Reports in Power BI Connecting Power BI to Snowflake Open Power BI Desktop and connect to the Snowflake database. Import the necessary tables into Power BI. Transform the data as needed in Power Query. Designing the Dashboard Create a blueprint for the dashboard, outlining key metrics and visuals. Implement the dashboard in Power BI, including cards, charts, and filters. Finalize the layout and design for better user experience.

Conclusion
In this blog post, we have covered the entire process of an end-to-end DWBI project, from data generation and extraction to loading into Snowflake and creating reports in Power BI. This comprehensive guide serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the complete data integration process in a real-world scenario.
